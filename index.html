    Nowadays, there is a misconception that to have healthy looking skin you need to incorporate many products into your skin care routine.
    Architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe once said "Less is more".
    A simple skin care routine and keeping a few aspects in mind will go a long way.
    Below are a few things to avoid for good skin:
    </p>
      <h2>Smoking</h2>

      <p>The toxins in cigarette smoke destroys the fibrous components like collagen and elastin which gives the skin strength and elasticity.</p>
      <h2>Prolonged sun exposure</h2>
      <img src="sun.jpg" alt="">
      <p>UV rays damages the fibres in your skin called elastin. When these fibres break down, your skin begins to stretch and lose its ability to go back into place before tsretching.</p>
      <h2>Processed foods</h2>
