  <p>A simple skincare routine will not involve all sorts of masks, serums, toners, etc. You will only need a cleanser, moisturizer and sun protection. You need to consider your skin type and make sure that all products should be gentle to your skin.</p>
    <h2>Cleanser</h2>

    <p>A cleanser must be used twice a day. It is prefered to wash your face before bed to wash away all the dirt from the day and in the morning. When using a cleanser,
      make sure it does not dry out your skin which would mean it is removing the oil the skin produces natually. You should not cleanse your face more than two times a day. It is the same concept as not washing your hair too often.</p>
    <h2>Moisturizer</h2>

    <p>A moisturizer must be used whenever you use a cleanser. It hydrates the top layer of the skin. Not only does moisturizing the skin help in preventing rashes and acne pores, it reduces the chances of skin cancer or inflammations as well. A few people suggest that you should not wear a moisturizer if you have oily skin which is not right.
      The skin produces more oil when it is dried out which means not moisturizing your skin will lead to more oily skin.</p>

    <h2>Sun protection</h2>

    <p>Unprotected sun exposure can cause skin cancer which is why even if you skip all the other steps, applying a sunscreen should never be ignored. Note that the harsh UV rays are present even during winterr times.
      It is advised to reduce your sun exposure time due to how harmful it is. Sunscreen must be applied on your neck along with your face.
      You can also wear a hat for extra care.</p>
